# AnachronoxDAT

This is a utility written in Python w/ a PyQt6 GUI in order to make it super easy to extract .DAT files from the Anachronox game directory (it will be in "anoxdata").
Thanks to the code available from John Rittenhouse's original utility, this was relatively simple.

Just select the folder you want the files to go to, then select the .DAT file you want to extract, all of the files will be extracted into that folder.
